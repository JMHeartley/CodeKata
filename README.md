Produce a method that takes 2 version numbers, in the format X.X.X.X (where X is a non-negative integer), and returns:
  -1 if version1 is lower than version2
  0 if the version numbers are the same
  1 if version1 is greater than version2

Examples: 
  "2.0.0.0" = "2" returns 0
  "2" < "1.5" returns 1
  "0.6" > "0.5" returns -1
